OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT 

PROJECT : EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

OBEJECTIVE 
 To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and implement a Linear Regression Model using the Diabetes Dataset. Analyze the dataset's structure, distributions, and relationships between features to predict a continuous target variable effectively.
 
 KEY FEATURES :
  
  EDA Analysis:
    Visualizations of distributions, correlations, and relationships between variables.
Regression Modeling:
    Selection of a key feature (BMI) to predict the target variable.
    Model training, testing, and performance evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
Visualization Tools:
   Histograms for feature distribution.
   Heatmap for correlations.
   Scatter plots for predictions vs actual values.
